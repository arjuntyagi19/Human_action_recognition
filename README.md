# Human Action Recognition using CNN + LSTM

This project implements a deep learning model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to recognize human actions from video sequences.

## Project Overview

Human Action Recognition (HAR) is a key task in computer vision, with applications in surveillance, sports analytics, and human-computer interaction. This project leverages the strengths of CNNs for spatial feature extraction and LSTMs for temporal pattern recognition, enabling robust action recognition from video frames.

## Features

- **Spatial-Temporal Feature Extraction:** Combines CNNs for spatial feature extraction with LSTMs for capturing temporal dependencies.
- **Customizable Architecture:** Easily adjustable to handle different datasets and hyperparameter configurations.
- **Visualization:** Includes visualization of model predictions and training performance.

## Dataset

The project uses a video-based dataset where each video corresponds to a specific action label. Each video is preprocessed into frames, which are passed through the CNN-LSTM pipeline.
